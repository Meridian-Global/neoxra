BRAND VOICE:

- Avoid phrases: {avoid_phrases}
- Signature moves: lead with specific observation, show the work, end with question or next step

=== INSTAGRAM ===
{instagram_output}

=== THREADS ===
{threads_output}

=== LINKEDIN ===
{linkedin_output}

STEP 1 — CROSS-PLATFORM ANALYSIS (be specific, not generic):
Look at all three posts together and identify:
1. Duplicated angles: are two posts making the same point or using the same hook?
2. Off-brand moments: specific lines that sound corporate, preachy, or guru-ish
3. Weak hooks or endings: which post opens or closes weakly, and exactly why

STEP 2 — REWRITE each post to fix the issues you found:
- Cut hedging language ("kind of", "maybe", "sometimes")
- Cut explanatory sentences that tell instead of show
- Cut business-speak and preachy takeaways
- Make each post's angle distinct from the others
- Keep hashtags specific or remove them entirely
- Shorten by at least 15%

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "notes": "2-4 sentences: what you found across all three posts — specific issues, not generic feedback",
  "instagram_improved": "improved instagram caption here",
  "threads_improved": "improved threads post here",
  "linkedin_improved": "improved linkedin post here"
}}

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.
